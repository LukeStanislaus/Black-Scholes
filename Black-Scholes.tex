\section{Introduction}

In the first section of my essay, I plan to outline what happened in February with
GameStop and the internet, showing graphs of the situation, for example 
%\href{https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/02/us/gamestop-stock-promo-1612301679434/gamestop-stock-promo-1612301679434-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.png}{the stock price over time} 
%and the \href{https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F034d8f30-6237-11eb-a858-6b1fccb4dc6e-standard.png?dpr=1&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&source=next&width=700}{short interest} 
in GameStop, in order to motivate the reader in our analysis of the Black-Scholes formula
under the bizarre situation of GameStop. I can also talk about similar situations 
in the past of similar significant "short squeezes", and consider how analysing 
GameStop could allow us to predict future short squeezes with different companies by 
analysing their financial situation. 
\paragraph
I would then move on to explaining the Black-Scholes Model, and could attempt a simple 
derivation of the Black-Scholes Formula. I can then move on to solving the 
formula for different intial conditions and variables, using my tools from 
Programming for Scientists last year to generate graphs of the predicted stock value 
(and value of options) in Python, where suitable. I will then take a conclusion from 
my calculations, deciding whether the prelevence of GameStop on messageboards and 
the internet is what caused the large spike, or if the high short interest in GameStop 
meant that it was inevitable to happen anyway.
\paragraph
I would expect to use Jupyter notebook and Python for graph sketching, and I plan to 
reference "Stochastic Differential Equations: An Introduction with Applications" by 
Bernt Karsten Ã˜ksendal, and "Options, Futures and Other Derivatives" by John C. Hull 
as part of writing my essay, as they contain critical information relevant to my topic.
Below is the Black-Scholes formula:

$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} 
+ rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0$
Where t is time in years, r is the interest rate, S is the price of the underlying asset 
and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the stock's returns.
\paragraph
I can also talk about other, more complicated financial models and how they compared to 
Black-Scholes, for example which assumptions they start to calculate which are ignored
in Black-Scholes.

$\ A(t) = rA(t) $

Let's cite! Einstein's journal paper \cite{einstein} and Dirac's
book \cite{dirac} are physics-related items.

\section{Asset dynamics}

\subsection{A risk-free asset}
A risk-free asset, as defined in The Black-Scholes Model \cite{blackscholes} can be thought
of as a money-market account with zero risk, for example a bank account with an interest 
rate. It is described by the deterministic function 
\begin{equation} \label{riskfree}
    dA(t) = rA(t)\mathrm{d}t 
\end{equation}
Where in \ref{riskfree}, $r$ represents the risk-free rate and $A$ the value of the 
asset. We typically let $r>0$ and $A(0) = 1$ for convenience. This can be rewritten as 
the ordinary differential equation $A'(t) = rA(t)$, which has the unique solution 
\begin{equation} \label{riskfree solution}
    A(t) =e^{rt}
\end{equation}
\subsection{Ito processes}

According to Ito process \cite{itoprocess}, an Ito process is the stochastic (random) 
process $X = \{X_t, t>=0\}$ which solves 
\begin{equation} \label{randomprocess}
X_t = X_0 + \int_{0}^{t} a(X_s, s)\mathrm{d}s + 
\int_{0}^{t} b(X_s, s) \mathrm{d}W_s
\end{equation}
Here $X_0$ is the "scalar starting point", and $a,b$ are stochastic 
processes defined for $\{a(X_t, t) : t\geq0\} $ and $\{b(X_t, t) : t\geq0\}$. 
Then we call $a$ the drift of the variable, and $b$ is the diffusion, 
or more precisely in a financial context, volatity. \ref{randomprocess} is commonly 
written as 
\begin{equation}
    X_t = a(X_t, t)\mathrm{d}t + b(X_t, t)\mathrm{d}W_t
\end{equation}
or even 
\begin{equation}
    X_t = a_t\mathrm{d}t + b_t\mathrm{d}W_t
\end{equation}
This converges at some time $T$ to Brownian motion with instantaneous drift $a_T$ and
variance $b_T^2$. We let $dW$ be normally distributed with mean zero and variance 
$\mathrm{d}t$. Then we can further simplify \ref{randomprocess} as 
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{d}X_t = a_t\mathrm{d}t + b_t \sqrt{\mathrm{d}t}\xi
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \xi \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\,\sigma^{2})
\end{equation}
As defined in \cite{itoprocess}, Ito's lemma is 

\begin{lemma}[Ito's Lemma]
    Suppose $f: R \to R$ is twice continuously differentiable and 
    $\mathrm{d}X = a_t\mathrm{d}t + b_t\mathrm{d}W$. Then $f(X)$ is the Ito process,
    \begin{equation}
        f(X_t)
        = f(X_0) + \int_0^t \! f'(X_s)a_s \, \mathrm{d}s + 
        \int_0^t \! f'(X_s)b_s \, \mathrm{d}W + \frac{1}{2}\int_0^t \! f''(X_s)b_s^2 \,
         \mathrm{d}s
    \end{equation}
    for $t\ge0$
\end{lemma}

\subsection{A risky asset}

A risk asset, as defined in The Black-Scholes Model \cite{blackscholes}, 
can be thought of as a stock, is represented as the Ito process

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{d}S(t) = \mu S(t)\mathrm{d}t + \sigma S(t) \mathrm{d}W(t)
\end{equation}

with $S(0)$ a given starting price of the stock, $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ 
is again the drift and $\sigma > 0$ is the volatility of the stock price $S$.
